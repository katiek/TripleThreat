                        Unlike past semesters, in DGMDE-15, Spring 2016, we were asked to pair up and get to know a peer in our class in order to create a People Page Card for them. Unfortunately, the image of my classmate is no longer available, but this is<a href="https://codepen.io/katiek/pen/OMrxpo">the Codepen</a> I created for her. My design was inspired from our interview and the whimsical nature of the profile picture she wanted to use. Her headshot was of her holding a rainbow umbrella on her shoulder. I designed the card to spin just as I imagined someone twirling an umbrella resting on their shoulder.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Because Suzi's image is no longer available, I am providing you with an <a href="https://codepen.io/anon/pen/GPrQxq">additional Codepen</a> containing an image similar to the image Suzi provided me. The image I used was an image &quot labeled for reuse with modification &quot from a Google search I preformed.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I believe the People Page Card exercise in DGMD E&ampS-15 was a simple way to dive deep into what is possible through CSS and JavaScript. I am especially proud of <a href="http://katiek.github.io/PeoplePageCard/">the People Page Card</a> I created for DGMDS-15. I applied my Photoshop skills to my headshot and I used CSS to make the image come alive.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        One thing my DGMD E&ampS-15 instructors asked of their student is to journal about what going on during their time in their course. Initially, I started off by handwriting my notes and meetings, for me that was the easiest way and overtime I began to create a journal through GitHub and <a href="http://katiek.github.io/">the personal page</a> they allow each GitHub account. In DGMDE-15, Spring 2016, I decided to personalize this page. I used what I had learned about HTML, CSS, and Javascript to create a bulletin board, with clickable dates that would launch a post-it with a thumb tack pinning it to the board (both elements I created from scratch with CSS).
                        <ul>
                            <li class="ns"><a href="https://s3.amazonaws.com/katiek/DGMD_E_S_15/CodePDFs/myJournalCode.html">My Journal Code</a></li>
                        </ul>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        When I decided to make the final changes to the Pixel Ruler design, a project from my first instance of DGMDE-15, I knew it would be a challenge, but I could never imagine how difficult creating a decreased opacity in greyscale would be. Here is more insight to how it was ultimately accomplished:
                    </p>

                        Creating the clickable square website was a programatic challange and had many iterations. (See Also <a href="https://katiek.github.io/TripleThreat/project2016.html">Final Project &amp Next Steps</a>) Here are a few different user interfaces that happened along the way:</p>
                    <ul>

                        Two years after creating my &quot Square Peeps &quot page, my 8-year-old neighbor saw me playing with it and asked if she could try. Of course I said yes. I was curious as to what intrigued her about it, but I was also concerned because she has only used PCs. I did not want her to become discouraged or frustrated by my design because she was using a Mac for the first time.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Not only was she able to figure out a Mac touchpad, she created her own special design through my web page and she was thrilled with her design.

                        To this day, Olivia still plays with "Your Game" as she calls it. I think we are both amazed by what she creates. From dollhouse layouts to practicing print letters, we are both excited and surprised but what she can design using a grid. She has not once asked me for help which tells me as a designer and developer, the time and effort I put into creating all of the web app features I deemed necessary for human-centered design were essential and this web app has exceeded my expectations.

                        The following two &quot Web and Appllication Design &quot courses were covered in DGMD E-15 and S-15, because of the self-directed project paths I chose.
                    </p>
                    <p>

                    <p>
                        I took CSCIE-12 after all instances of DGMD E&ampS-15. DGMD E&ampS-15 covered similar material as CSCIE-12, but in a different way. I would like to point out that I successfully completed CSCIE-12 and I believe I was able to push myself further than the general expectations laid out in CSCIE-12 because of the foundation established in Creative Explorations of Screen-Based and Physical Computing.

                        In DGMD E-15, Spring 2016, I used various technology that currently is content found in &quot Web and Appllication Design &quot courses. There is not a current single course that lists all of what was used so I have listed the technology introduced and utilized in DGMDE-15, Spring 2016:
                        <ul>

                        While reviewing my request that DGMDE-15, Spring 2016 be counted as a &quot Web and Appllication Design &quot course, the website I built and present to you today is a direct result of the semester in question. This website houses all of my work and experience from 3 semesters of Creative Explorations of Screen-Based and Physical Computing and I respectively ask that you consider this as another project of the tools and knowledge I gained in the Spring of 2016.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Thank you again for your time and consideration of my request.
