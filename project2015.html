                    <h3>Final Project</h3>
                    <p>
                        On April 14th, 2015, I met with two of my instructors to review some HTML basics and I built my first "Hello World" page seen in the screenshot below.
                    </p>
                    <div class="text-center">
                        <img src="img/The_html_that_started_it_all.jpg" width="80%" height="80%">
                    </div>
                    <p>
                        I became frustrated with my inability to align text or divs where I wanted them to be. We happened to be using px as the measure and I asked, "Isn't there a pixel ruler I could use?" If I were laying out a page in the physical world, I would grab a ruler to find the distance I needed to move the element for proper alignment on the page. This is where screen-based design and I struggled. It was not tangible and I had no control.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Two days after this meeting, I emailed my instructors asking them if I could switch my final project and create an on-screen pixel ruler. I was more excited about this idea than anything else and my instructors approved my request. Then commenced a very intense month of design and build. The project was heavy on the JS, you can find snippits and all the tests I ran at my <a href="https://github.com/katiek/Pixel_This">pixel ruler repository</a>. For my <a href="https://s3.amazonaws.com/katiek/Binder4.pdf">final presentation</a>, I walked my peers through the why and how. I also shared the final product,
                        <a href="https://s3.amazonaws.com/katiek/pixelthis_one.html">a bookmarklet</a> and the
                        <a href="https://s3.amazonaws.com/katiek/pixelthis_now.js">JS</a>.
                    </p>
                    <h3>Next Steps</h3>
                    <p>
                        I was extremely proud to create a digital version of a tool from the physical world. I may not have that much control over the language and the syntax of code, and if I stay in this field, I won't be able to control that, but I know now that I can digitally build tools to control the affect of those things.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        There were still some tweaks I needed to do on the ruler. The color palette is less than desirable, but overall, I work out the kinks and functionality of the design so someone could begin using it immediately. I had high hopes for Gittish. It is a project that resonates with me because of my personal relationship and struggle with language. I also know I am not the only person who may feel alienated from the tech world. I believe it is time for new blood to enter the field and bring with it new perspective. I would love to help facilitate that in some way.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        At this time, I believed that I needed to get more experience using the languages that I would one day like to manipulate, so my immediate plans focused on making more.
