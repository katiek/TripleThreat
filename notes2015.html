                    <p>
                        Since learning of the terminal in my computer, I was a bit obsessed. For the first few months, I was fascinated by it and almost all my conversations and studies were centered around it. The first programming language I was introduced to was Bash. My instructors showed me how to use it in the terminal, assuring me that I would not be able to do something one of them could not undo. With that in mind, I dubbed myself a <em>basher</em> and I began <em>bashing</em>.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        From my interactions with the terminal and Bash, I became intrigued albeit frustrated by programming and the languages. I spoke with my instructors and they explained that programming languages are their <em>own</em> kind of languages. This prompted me to dig deeper and I connected that to my personal relationship to the English language. I thought I would give myself a gift that semester and design a programming language that was more intuitive to <em>me</em>.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I began with a tutorial one of my instructors asked me to do to get familiar with Bash:
                        <ul>
                            <li style="list-style-type: none;"><b>How to run an interactive script in the terminal...</b></li>
                            <ul>
                                <li>Create a new text file in Sublime Text.</li>
                                <li>Add the following lines of code to that file:</li>
                                <li>
                                    <kbd>echo "What is your name?"</kbd>
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                    <kbd>read their_name</kbd>
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                    <kbd>echo "Hi $their_name!"</kbd>
                                </li>
                                <li>Save the file. You can call it whatever you'd like, but should end the file name with .sh Let's say you call it file.sh</li>
                                <li>Now, go to your terminal. Make sure that you cd into the directory where you saved the file (e.g. if you saved it to the Desktop, cd into Desktop) and then run the command:</li>
                                <li>
                                    <kbd>source file.sh</kbd>
                                </li>
                                <li>You should be asked what your name is in the terminal and be able to get a response to it.</li>
                            </ul>
                        </ul>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        This was the beginning of what I thought would be the best final project and gift I would ever give - a language that would be useful in programming and one that I would understand. I had decided to call my language <a href="https://github.com/katiek/Gittish"><b>Gittish</b></a> and it was to combine Git and English into an intuitive language for those who may struggle with either or both of them. One would be able to access Gittish via running the command,
                        <kbd><small>source gitti.sh</small></kbd> in the terminal.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The greatest hurdle I would face was in gaining a thorough understanding of Git, the terminal, and Bash. I needed to learn why we need them, how they got here, how they work, how they work together, what happens if we didn't have them, what are the most popular uses for them...</p>
                    <p>
                        My instructors sent videos about <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U8GBXvdmHT4">git commands</a> and
                        <a href=" https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQsBmnZvBdc">push/pull requests.</a> Along with extensive independent study, I met almost weekly, one-on-one, with an instructor to explore the new tech and languages being introduced. I attended all the studios that I could.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        During class, we were introduced to all kinds of technology and programming capabilities. I downloaded and set up my first text editor, <a href="http://www.sublimetext.com/">Sublime Text</a> to practice the <a href="https://github.com/dgmde15/HTML.CSS.JS-Intro">basics of HTML/CSS/JS from the course demo</a>. I set up my <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/s3/">AWS S3 account</a> although I had no idea what to do with an account like that. There was time during class devoted to testing out <a href="https://www.tessel.io/">a Tessel</a> running commands in the terminal as you can find in <a href="Spring2015/TerminalHistoryDGMDES15.txt">this copy of my terminal history</a>. We explored other people's digital gifts through forking their repositories like, <a href="https://github.com/dgmd/letterpress-clone">Letterpress</a> and <a href="https://github.com/dgmd/a-story-in-pomes">a-story-in-pomes</a>. We also got to play with an <a href="https://lookingglassfactory.com/product/l3d-cube/">L3D Cube</a> through an in-browser interface, <a href="https://github.com/dgmd/3D-GIF">3D-GIF</a>. All of these experiences led me to think of more digital gifts and I would jot down in my notebook.

                        That spring, I was a toddler who just learned to walk. I wanted to go everywhere and try everything. It was hard to keep up with myself but every so often I was able to go to my notebook and write down notes about what was going on and what I thought.

<!-- Notes from instructor about How terminal and bash work -->
<!-- Hurray! As we've talked a little about, the terminal "understands" and "speaks" a programming language called bash (similar to how the browser "understands" javascript). Here are some notes I took based on a “Wait, how does the terminal work?!” convo we had: Some things to know about bash in the terminal... ls, cd, pwd, history, and many of the other commands you use at the terminal are all bash commands. The same way we name JavaScript files whateverTheNameIs.js, we call bash files whateverTheNameIs.sh In bash, a $ indicates something is a variable name. In order to "run" a bash script at the terminal, the command you use is "source". We did this when we added a new alias to your .bash_profile file. We ran the file by typing "source .bash_profile" so that the new alias would begin working immediately. e.g. if you run "man echo" at the terminal it will give you some explanation of how the bash command echo works. Here is an example function for “re-writing git” / Gittish we wrote together: function git_add { echo "You should not be storing large media files like photos, videos, audio, etc. in a git repository. Do you have any of those in this repository now? (Yes/No)" read answer if [ $answer = "Yes" ]; then echo "Please remove those large files and try 'git_add' again!" elif [ $answer = "No" ]; then git add . else echo "You typed $answer but we need you to let type either 'Yes' or 'No'. Please try 'git_add' again and provide one of those answers!" fi } https://github.com/katiek/Gittish.git -->
