You never know what you’ll find, what it will be next to, etc. Hence the “random” polaroids. The links below are about some of the effects you wanted to create on those Polaroids... Hi Katie, It was really great to talk with you today about quantum physics, pedicures, and the historical aspects of thrift store shopping. All leading to what might be a pretty awesome project idea. I wanted to send along this gist, which is a quick example of "straightening up" some slanted divs (you can imagine replacing them with images and having them overlap, etc.) I also wanted to point you at this example from the HTML/CSS library we shared last week as a possible way to animate your /people card wink (e.g. having a few panels of an open eye followed by one of a wink). This is just one way to do it, and you might also (as we discussed) want to do something that changes the background image (to a winking face) when you click the "flip" button. We can talk more tomorrow about this one! Oh! And I also said I'd send along this 3D image from Matt (from last year's class) just to enjoy =) hoping you are well, -shaunalynn

                        Here are some readings I sent you during the Summer course around different ways of learning, knowing, and also some “Intro to Coding” style online resources. Thank you for sharing this, and sorry we didn't get to touch base today, but actually pretty glad you got to have a great conversation with Elise! So, in the end, it's all great. In other news, here's some things I said I'd send you: Epistemological Pluralisms is the essay I mentioned about different (sometimes gendered) approaches to programming and how they're all deep/valid/etc. Also, I love this site for perusing fonts, re: our discussion of wanting handwriting-like, script fonts. Also, here's something about the "!important" CSS "trick." And finally, Code Academy has some worksheet-like things you might enjoy walking through. They have this HTML/CSS and Javascript focused tracks, as well as ones for other languages. Let me know if this is what you were imagining or if I should brainstorm other ideas. Hope you have a great visit to Nantucket this weekend! Thursday, August 6, 2015, 4-6PM — Meeting with Shaunalynn During this Summer, you also created the blinking people card. You talked about wanting to talk about how you learned to use Amazon S3 to store media and how to build on top of existing tools in order to create digital projects.

                         love this story!  Our class is technically called "Creative Explorations in Screen-based and Physical Computing."  Quite a mouthful, BUT I think we are pretty true to the title, strangely.  It's not an "intro to programming" but you have to program to "creatively explore" these technologies.  I'd love to hear your ideas about naming/renaming.  =)

Hope you are having a great weekend in Nantucket and see you soon!

warmly, 
-shaunalynn

Dear Shaunalynn,

Thank you so much for sending these links, I am going to check them out now. 

I felt badly that I did not get to touch base with you yesterday. I did have a great conversation with Elise and you were totally right that she is a cool girl and it's great we have studio time to not only work but also get to know one another on a more personal level so thank you for letting us carry on as we did. I hope we weren't a distraction to anyone else.

Final little aside, Molly's boyfriend, Jake drove the three of us down to Hyannis and we took the boat over to Nantucket together. Well we arrived and my father picked us up and on the way to drop them off at their car we were all schmoozing a bit and my dad asked, "So what's the name of the class that you and Molly are taking together?" I kind of  mumbled "design computing studies with programming?" Molly then says "no, it's a coding class." My dad quips, "well nothing new here... reminds me of you telling me the name of your class last semester!" Molly and I respond, "It's the same class!" We all had a good laugh and my father now fully understands how one can become obsessed with this class and how we hope to have the same instructors forever.

Frankly, I love that I don't know what the class is called outside of DGMDE15, truthfully I struggle with that too but I think it's all part of what makes this class so special and unique.

I hope you have a great weekend and I can't wait to show you my progress on Monday!!

Sincerely,

                        After installing software and connecting to my Github account via my terminal, I felt that there was no stopping me. I learned so much that first day. I learned that computers have more features than email or Microsoft Word and I learned I would have to be genuine and honest with myself, my instructors, and my peers in order to get the most out of my experience. That was what I did all semester and I could not have imagined what a positive and enlightening experience I would have.

                        The instructors made it so easy to connect with them and your peers. They had two weekend studio sessions all students could attend and if you asked to meet with them to work one-on-one, they would find the time. I tried to take advantage of all that they offered. I still needed to create a digital gift but I was still hung up on how bizarre programming languages are and I had so many questions about that. My instructors answered to the best of their ability, but the greatest thing they did was not dismiss my out-of-box thinking. I had no fear sharing my thoughts and it was these conversations that shaped my work throughout the semester.
