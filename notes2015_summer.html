                    <p>
                        The course appeared to have morphed during the one month between the spring and summer course. It did not take an entirely new shape, but it felt different than before. Granted I was different so that may have played into the change I felt. Maybe I was no longer the toddler who just began to walk like last semester? I grew up a bit and was seeing the world in a new light. </p>
                    <p>
                        I was intrigued in how to humanize the machine based tech world. It was great to have three instructors because it gave me different insight in this unfamiliar world I was entering. I was able to research this outside of class as well. They would sent me articles and websites to visit and I felt learning more about the computer science society and history made it easier for me to understand. </p>
                    <p>
                        Some of my favorite articles were <a href="http://www.papert.org/articles/EpistemologicalPluralism.html">Epistemological Pluralism and the Revaluation of the Concrete by Sherry Turkle and Seymour Papert</a>. I prefer to call it, "Computers Can't Love." Also, <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/graphics/2015-paul-ford-what-is-code/">What <i>is</i> Code? by Paul Ford</a> helped with my need to understand how we got here.

                        During the summer session we were also encouraged to journal digitally. <a href="Summer2015/journal2015.html">This was the first time</a> I had done that and it did not feel natural at all. It also prompted me to find ways to make typing feel more human and I began looking for a
                        <a href="https://typekit.com/fonts">handwritten font</a> to make the visual output feel less machine-made. Afterall, I am most certainly not a machine and I enjoy the most non-machine things. Spending time with people, I find human behaivor fascinating and learning about objects histories. The best part of that is finding the object that screams to be researched.

                        That passion of mine was what prompted phase two of my summer studies. I wanted a digital way to catalog, document, and present these objects I find. I began brainstorming and sketching some of those design ideas.

                        After I sketched those, we had a session learning about ways to sketch to increase productivity and design thinking. I often go into such detail, it hinders my ability to be creative and think outside of the parameters I set. One article that was particularly helpful to me was Jason Fried's, <a href="https://signalvnoise.com/posts/466-sketching-with-a-sharpie">"Sketching with a Sharpie"</a>. It broke me from the cycle of there being only one way to acheive my goal.
