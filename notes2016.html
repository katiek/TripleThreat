                        One thing I that I felt could drive me over the semester was to design things better for the user from the start. Avoid redesign. Even if it is something that I had no plan to develop on a large scale, I would still design with empathy for whomever would use it. I enjoyed learning about UX and it gave me something else to discuss with my instructors. Throughout the semester UX became a central theme for me. My instructors introduced me to new ways to learn and engage with the field.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        My instructors helped me familiarize myself with UX design and designers currently in the field. Some of my favorite things had me look at were designers' redesigns of <a href="https://stories.uplabs.com/the-no-nonsense-redesign-that-blew-our-minds-22abe19ae932">Google Play</a>,<a href="https://www.behance.net/gallery/10798561/Twitter-Redesign-Concept"> Twitter</a>, and
                        <a href="https://medium.com/@danmaccarone/the-ux-of-learning-ux-is-broken-f972b27d3273">an article to help familiarize myself with the field's jargon and concepts</a>. Another instructor showed me how you can create clickable html files and I was able to make a <a href="http://katiek.github.io/SkinGraph/">wireframe for Skin Graph</a>. That is Mole Measure's new name.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        To do that, I created <a href="https://pathbrite.com/portfolio/PTqYDCPdeS/dgmd-e-15-spring-2016/item/PTqYDCPdeSFP0gR9">the original Skin Graph sketches</a>. Not thrilled with their result, I remembered Jason Fried's, <a href="https://signalvnoise.com/posts/466-sketching-with-a-sharpie">"Sketching with a Sharpie"</a> I had read over the summer. Now it was time to try it out. These are my <a href="https://pathbrite.com/portfolio/PTqYDCPdeS/dgmd-e-15-spring-2016/item/PTqYDCPdeSOP6gR9">Sharpie version</a>. I used, Adobe Capture, a mobile app I learned about in class, to create the image files of my sketches I used in the HTML <a href="http://katiek.github.io/SkinGraph/">wireframe</a>. I presented my wireframe in class in the middle of the semester as an example of how you can create your own mockup.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I did look more into ways of developing Skin Graph. For the UX component I studied and and used similar apps already available. And for the the technology of how to image the irregularites of color on the skin surface, I familiarized myself with <a href="https://trackingjs.com/">tracking.js</a> and its <a href="https://trackingjs.com/examples/color_hello_world.html">image color detection</a>.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        At the time I was not convince that I wanted to develop skin graph and I took advantage of activities going on in class to help me dive a little deeper. That semester we used Codepen to create a people page card for another student in class. Unfortunately, the image of my classmate is no longer available, but this is<a href="https://codepen.io/katiek/pen/OMrxpo"> the Codepen</a>. To give more context to the design, my classmate was holding a rainbow umbrella on their shoulder and I designed the card to spin giving the illusion that the umbrella was spinning when flipped.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        At the beginning of March, I decided I wanted to modernize a <a href="https://s3.amazonaws.com/katiek/DGMD_E_S_15/collegeSquarePeeps.jpg">design from college</a>. I wanted to create a website of clickable square. In college, circa 2000 I developed that design using hand tools like scissors, rulers, art knives, and cardstock, rubber cement and posterboard. Now was the time to create that design on the screen. To help get me ready, I completed various <a href="https://pathbrite.com/portfolio/PTqYDCPdeS/dgmd-e-15-spring-2016/item/PTqYDCPdeSUPB4R9">W3Schools JavaScript exercises</a> and practiced other code snippets. This would develop into my final project for the semester.

                    <p>
                        Another project I spent some time on during this semester was building <a href="http://katiek.github.io/Corkboard_Journal/">my journal</a>. I wanted a way to hide entries and I thought it would be fun to build it as a corkboard with post-it note entries and thumbtacks. Also, here is the complete <a href="https://github.com/katiek/katiek.github.io/commits/master">journal version history</a>.
