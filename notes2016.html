                        And you started a mole detection project, called SkinGraph! http://katiek.github.io/SkinGraph/ There was all that UI stuff, but also “blob detection” which we explored through the code snippet below... Hey Katie! Just wanted to send along a link to the tool I thought we might look at tomorrow to start trying to figure out how to detect moles. After poking around, I think tracking.js might work and you can check out this example to see a picture in which three different colors are detected and then outlined. I thought tomorrow, we could try to get something like this up and running, set up a custom color to detect, and then start thinking about how we can define the whole range of colors (and contrasts) that moles might require! I don't remember if we chose a place, but is there any chance you could meet a little later than we said, at 11:30AM tomorrow at ... Crema Cafe again? looking forward, -shaunalynn

                        Wednesday, March 2, 2016, 11AM-1PM — Meeting with Shaunalynn Friday, March 11, 2016, 12-2PM — Meeting with Shaunalynn Digital Journal project Wednesday, April 6, 2016, 12-2PM — Meeting with Shaunalynn Katie, I spent some more time this morning getting squares to turn black and white. You can check out my code here, or else we can get together and work more on it. Feel free to take whatever approach makes the most sense to you! See you tomorrow? -shaunalynn

                        After installing software and connecting to my Github account via my terminal, I felt that there was no stopping me. I learned so much that first day. I learned that computers have more features than email or Microsoft Word and I learned I would have to be genuine and honest with myself, my instructors, and my peers in order to get the most out of my experience. That was what I did all semester and I could not have imagined what a positive and enlightening experience I would have.

                        Screenshot from our meeting about clickable squares! Some of the issues we worked to troubleshoot in this one included: Making the squares fill the page “infinitely” no matter how big you made the window But making sure they didn’t shift Making it so you could click and drag to highlight square

                        We also tried to update the pixel ruler, changing it to gray scale + all of the issues that ensued from there.

                        Hi Katie. I hope that this message finds you very well. Following up on our UX/UI design conversation, I want to share a few links that will hopefully spark some ideas and interests. The field of UX/UI design (in terms of concepts, tools, and practices) has been evolving quite rapidly in the past decade. There are a lot of courses on UI/UX design out there that can help orient you with respect to your interests; for example, here is a free course from Adobe based on their products. You can find other relevant courses using this site. I’m hoping to do something a little more idiosyncratic in this note. I will share a few links in hopes that they will be the basis of our subsequent conversations or your conversations with others. I hope this will be less course-like and more organically connects to your interests and passions. Diving in the deep end a bit, The UX of Learning UX is Broken is a recent opinion piece on the state of learning UX that you might find interesting. You might enjoy getting familiar with the lingo and some of the concepts in the field this way. With that article as context, here is an interview with one of the key members of design team for a promising product, Adobe XD, that’s attempting to address some of the things that designers and designer-developers have been wishing to have in their toolkit. To balance things off a bit :), here is the perspective of someone who worked on that product but just left to join InVision which is another company you might enjoy to check out. I also mentioned that there are designers out there who undertake design exercises to show off their taste, ideas, and skills. Fred Nerby is one such person. In particular, I would recommend his redesign concept for Twitter. I hope you will find these resources worthwhile. I am happy to set up a time to discuss if you would like. Warmly, Bakhtiar
