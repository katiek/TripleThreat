                    <h3>Final Project</h3>
                    <p>The <em>creative exploration</em> brought about by this course pushed me to get in touch with what I find interesting and what I enjoy. It was apparent that much of what I find interesting has little connection to machines. Over the summer I decided to do things differnetly. I bridged my interests and tech together for my final project. I did not present one project, but two.

                        Over the summer, I created something that felt alive. I created an animated People Page Card. People were able to see my headshot and know there was a real person behind that 2D image on the screen. I used all sorts of tools to make that happen. I manipulated images in Photoshop. I used HTML, CSS, and JS to create transitions and the flip. I bridged last semester to this one throught hosting images on my S3 account. I was shocked to learn the real world effects you can create in a 120px square that housed my <a href="http://katiek.github.io/PeoplePageCard/">People Page Card</a> on the course website.

                        The second project I started was the Found Object project, aka Bass Lady. As I said before, I love to go thrifting or stop at yard sales in random towns that I happen to be driving through. I never know what I might find and what I may learn. I enjoy sharing the stories of these objects with others. To find one of these objects is not easy. It takes time and there is no guarentee that you will find one. Sometimes they just happen to be on a shelf next to some other object that caught your eye or in the bottom of a sewing box you get for free at a yard sale. It is completely random and sometimes you have to dig for your treasure. This idea of searching and the randomness of what you may find and how you find it was what prompted the development of the randomly tossing the poloroids on a webpage. Please introduce yourself to the fabulous <a href="http://katiek.github.io/Bass_Lady/">Bass Lady</a>.

                        <p>
                            The design and build of the poloroids was quite extensive as well as the JS for the random toss, isolating, and straightening the image. This project has an extensive build-out and requires me to photograph and catalog all of my "finds." There may be a way to input that info into a JSON file to randomly fill the poloroid shells on the page. In the meantime, the Bass Lady makes me happy. She is the object that tells the story of my object project.

                            I plan on continuing to find ways of humanizing the machine world experience. It will take more practice and getting myself more involved with the inner world of digital design. I hope to document that journey in a softer, less 2D version of a journal. I plan on reworking my journal as it currently it is not formatted. It is lifeless, like a machine wrote it.
