                    <h3>Final Project</h3>
                    <p>The creative exploration brought about by this course was pushing me to get in touch with what I find interesting and what I enjoy. What was apparent is many of those things have little connection to machines, but over summer I tried to bridge them together and I decided to do something different for my final project. I was not going to present one project, but two.

                        Over the summer I wanted to create something that felt alive. I did that with the oppurtunity to create a People Page Card. I wanted people who see my headshot to think there may be a real person in that 2D image on the screen. I used all sorts of tools to make that happen. I manipulated images in Photoshop, I used HTML, CSS, and JS to create transitions and the flip, and I finally found a use for the S3 account I opened the last semester. I stored all the images needed to create the card there. I was shocked to learn all you can do to create a real world effect in a 120px square housing my <a href="http://katiek.github.io/PeoplePageCard/">People Page Card</a> on the course website.

                        The second project I started was the Found Object project, aka Bass Lady project. I love to go thrifting or stop at yard sales in random towns I happen to be driving through. I never know what I might fing and what I may learn from the object I find. I enjoy sharing the stories with others about thes objects, their provenance and what was happening in the world at that time. To find one of these objects is not easy. It takes time and there is no guarentee that you will find one. Sometimes they just happen to be on a shelf next to some other object that caught your eye or in the bottom of a sewing box you get for free at a yard sale. It is completely random and sometimes you have to dig for your treasure. This idea of searching and the randomness of what you may find and how you find it was what prompted the development of the randomly tossing the poloroids on a webpage. Please introduce yourself to the fabulous <a href="http://katiek.github.io/Bass_Lady/">Bass Lady</a>.

                        <p>
                            The design and build of the poloroids was quite extensive as well as the JS for the random toss and isolating and straightening the image. This project has an extensive build out and requires me to photograph and catalog all of my finds. There may be a way to imput that info into a JSON file to randomly fill the poloroid shells on the page. In the meantime, the bass lady makes me happy. She is the object that tells the story of my object project.

                            I also plan on continuing to find ways of humanizing the machine world experience. It will take more practice and getting myself more involved with the inner world of digital design. I hope to document that journey in a softer, less 2D version of a journal. I plan on reworking that next as it currently has no formatting to it. It feels lifeless, like a machine wrote it.
