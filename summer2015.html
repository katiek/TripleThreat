                    <h3><strong>Mindset</strong></h3>
                    <p>
                        The spring of 2015 marked a major change in my life. Less than one year prior, I had been living in New York City and just learned I had been suffering from living with an undiagnosed language-based learning disability. Learning this about myself, fully explained my whole life to me. Although I had graduated from college 12 years prior to that spring of 2015, I had not been able to make anything of my formal education and I had yet to learn what <em>I</em> enjoy doing, but now I knew the reason why. I was also given a second shot at figuring this out through going to graduate school and this time I was going to do things completely different than before.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I thought I might enjoy graphic design and I began looking at Harvard Extension School Digital Media Design course offerings. That was when I came across DGMDE-15. It was not a graphic design course, but I was immediately intrigued after reviewing the course syllabys. The course had taken a world I knew nothing about and often feared, <em>technology</em>, and made it familiar through something I knew well from the physical world. The approach, creating a digital gift for someone. I have enjoyed giving gifts and I had been a pretty great gift giver. That confidence was why I was able to move pass my fear and try something new and unexpected. I registered for my first course at Harvard Extension School unaware of the mind-blowing and eye-opening journey I was about to embark on.

                    <h3><strong>Experience</strong></h3>
                    <p>
                        The first day of class could have been the last day of class because, it was a success and worthwhile experience. I had no idea what to expect from myself or this course and that first day during class, we set up our "environment" for the semester. That included creating a Github account, connect to the server, and download various software needed onto our computers via the terminal. I thought to myself, "The terminal?!?! What the heck is that?" That's when I did the opposite of every other learning experience I've had. I did not keep the words to myself. I said them aloud whether it made sense or not and the most incredible thing happened. My instructors helped me find my terminal. I was completely in awe that there was this little window that controlled my computer and I could tell it to do things. My mind was blown.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        After installing software and connecting to my Github account via my terminal, I felt that there was no stopping me. I learned so much that first day. I learned that computers have more features than email or Microsoft Word and I learned I would have to be genuine and honest with myself, my instructors, and my peers in order to get the most out of my experience. That was what I did all semester and I could not have imagined what a positive and enlightening experience I would have.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The instructors made it so easy to connect with them and your peers. They had two weekend studio sessions all students could attend and if you asked to meet with them to work one-on-one, they would find the time. I tried to take advantage of all that they offered. I still needed to create a digital gift but I was still hung up on how bizarre programming languages are and I had so many questions about that. My instructors answered to the best of their ability, but the greatest thing they did was not dismiss my out-of-box thinking. I had no fear sharing my thoughts and it was these conversations that shaped my work throughout the semester.
