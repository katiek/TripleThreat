                    <h3>DGMDS-15: Summer 2015</h3>
                    <p>
                        After just finishing what I believed was a very successful spring term, a few classmates of mine mentioned that they were going to enroll for the summer session of DGMD S-15. I could not think of a better course to take that would allow me a deeper dive into programming and commputing than this one. I was interested to see what I would do with all the knowledge I acquired over the spring. I was not the person then as I was starting the spring term in January. My baseline for thinking and processing had changed which meant I had no idea where I would end up at the end of the summer session.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        One thing I did know was I had the <em>maker</em> bug ever since finishing my Pixel Ruler in May. I wanted to continue to create and make, but I was apprehensive about the shortened summer session. <em>Could I actually make something as cool as the Pixel Ruler? Could I even think of something to make in less time?</em> My apprehension quickly shifted to excitement on the first day of the summer session.</p>
                    <p>
                        The instructors once again offered their time to those in the class and they stayed long after class was done so we could continue working. They moved the weekend studios to everyday after class. Having the extended work time was amazing and you had even more of an oppurtunity to learn about what others were developing. I had no idea then that I would spend weeks in awe of all the creative ways there are to add value to your own life or others through digital design. I did know that if at the end of the summer session, I created something else that made the screen-based world feel ever more slightly like the physical world, it would time well spent. <strong>Spoiler Alert...</strong><em>It was</em>.
