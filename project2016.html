                    <h3>Final Project</h3>
                    <p>
                        This semester was the epitome of complex design issues arising from a rather simple design idea. My idea to create a large canvas with infinite black and white clickable squares, had a slew of programming issues to overcome.
                    </p>

                    Some of the most challanging issues to troubleshoot were dealing with the canvas and window size. As you can see in the "Issue Gallery," one major hurdle was making the squares fill the canvas no matter how big you make the window while making sure they do not shift when you enlarge the window. Adding the click-n-drag feature was a user friendly tool. In the end, <a href="http://katiek.github.io/square_peeps/">Square Peeps</a> was challenging, but completely worth it.

                    Like I said in my notes, I wanted to design things better, avoiding redesign. Coming full circle, I had this lingering desire to tweak my Pixel Ruler. I wanted to look at it and be proud. I wanted aesthically pleasing colors and design. So, I began the surprisingly messy task of changing the ruler to grayscale. I never could have imagined the things that I would need to accomplish the redesign. For example a <a href="https://drive.google.com/open?id=10t3dZg03Bz5jUsl_4zgbgz4_KUQdRhKgiueWrCGgLvI ">pixel ruler hue calculation table</a>.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Through it all, I remained optimistic. It is one of the many reasons why I love DGMD E/S-15. You cannot predict what will happen and even when you feel there is no solution, you have three people helping you reach your goal with unwavering support. This may not have been my final project that spring but I felt an incredible feeling of accomplishment after the <a href="http://katiek.github.io/Pixel_Ruler/ ">Pixel Ruler</a> was in grayscale.
                </p>
                <h3>Next Steps</h3>
                <p>
                    Well the next major step is to officially start graduate school at HES. I was accepted into the Digital Media Design Master Program during spring semester 2016. I also plan to continue my own version of Creative Exploration of Screen-Based and Physical Computing. It will probably look a lot like DGMD E/S-15. Bite off more than you can chew, knowing you have built a strong support system throughout the course. I will continue to ask questions and I will stay forever curious which seems to uncover the most interesting things. I will look into more UX/UI design and remember to always be empathetic.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I want to revisit previous projects and build upon that code. I like that you can take code from one project and put it into another, and all of a sudden, you have something completely different. One of my key take-aways from my studies is that doing something is better than doing nothing- even if you don't understand what it is that you are doing. All it takes is the academic support to build your confidence to get from nothing to something. Spring of 2015 I was a newbie and expected nothing further than a digital gift. But each Creative Exploration Course allowed me to build upon what I had at that time, until the point where I am at now, a new website, a journal, and several web-based applications. None of which I would have accomplished without the creative exploration of my own knowledge combined with my interests, each instance I took this course.
