                    <h3>DGMDE-15: Spring 2016</h3>
                    <p>
                        A lot happened since my last successful round of Creative Explortation of Screen-Based and Physical Computing. The amount I learned in those two semesters motivated me to register for more classes in the Digital Media Design durning the fall semester at HES. In addition, I began toying with the idea of applying into the graduate program at HES. It had been such a positive experience thus far. I spoke with Admissions, and they informed me that I met all the criteria and I was given the go ahead to apply that fall. That is exactly what I did.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        When I began in the spring, I had two other HES course to build from and I was very excited to see what would happen in DGMDE-15: Spring 2016. One of the courses I took in the fall was UX Engineering. Students in that course had to go through all the steps of planning out the UX for one web app, software, website, wearable, etc of their choice. I thought I would develop Gittish's UX and I would be one step closer to buiding it come the spring. Fast forward to the first day of the spring term and I am told GitHub launched<a href="https://desktop.github.com/"> GitHub Desktop</a> which was similar to Gittish as it moved the user from the terminal to a stand alone app and the intergration and UX was pretty awesome. That semester I used it and found nothing to critique. It was a good design.

                        There I was, starting at the beginning except this time, I had so much more experience and knowledge about the screen-based world compared to when I walked into the same classroom a year prior. I was excited to start the creative exploration process at this stage. I was not going to get hung up on the same things that come along with being brand new. I had honed in on things I was interested in and now I would get to explore those things. Not everything I focused on would stem from how bizarre I found some of the languages and norms to be. Although those always made for entertaining conversations. I would not fully let go of those things but maybe for a semester I could look beyond it.
