    Randomness of the toss and the sort you have to go through mimics the process of "finding" things at a yard sale
    objects that increase in value as you use them vs those that may not
    glass thermometer and sterling case vs digital thermometer that you throw away. Today people may not even touch a thermometer ever and the disconnect that could happen when you don't touch an object
    Large Mouth Bass Lady could be my "about" page link to the story of the process of getting to this point and document that story
    Why does a tactile object always cement a story or memory for me?
    Why do I remember the exact places, time of day, state of mind, sometimes clothing, bags, movements, other people through an object and especially one I can hold? I remember holding it the first time and maybe that helps? Remembering the person who tells me about an object or expands on what I already know
    don't be afraid to share stories via objects - great way to document my own life story via this
    objects I no longer have and it drives me nuts: arrowheads I found with Jeanne Casy and left at the house she was watching when she was babysitting me. It had a waterbed, maybe in Polpis?
    Car blanket from when I was little with bot and girl holding hands, fancy but acrylic, purchased from Neimans or Saks.

    "clients from hell" Tumblr Adrienne's suggestion for a bad day...
    keynote seems to be how people present ideas. What is Reveal?? 

    Ask tim about Machineing next door. Where is "next door"?

    Canvas would be a cool way for Amir's daughter to use the cube.
